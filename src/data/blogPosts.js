            intro: "For years, the wood-burning stove has been the ultimate symbol of cozy, sustainable living. But a new government report released this morning is about to extinguish that glow. New data reveals that wood burners are now a larger source of fine particle pollution (PM2.5) than road traffic in some areas. As of 2026, new stoves will carry mandatory health warnings similar to cigarette packets. Here is what you need to know before you light your next fire.",

The problem is microscopic PM2.5 particles that can bypass our lung defenses and enter the bloodstream. The new government report confirms that shifting from open fires to stoves helps, but nowhere near enough.",

            intro: `"Take, make, waste"—that's been our economic model for decades. But in 2026, a revolution is happening. The circular economy—where products are designed to last, repaired when broken, and recycled at end of life—is going mainstream. Fashion rental is booming. Right-to-repair laws are passing. Major brands are launching take-back programs. You can now return your iPhone to Apple, rent your wardrobe from H&M, and fix your broken blender at a neighborhood repair café. Here are 8 ways to join the circular revolution.`,

                    content: `2026 marks major victories for the right-to-repair movement. The EU and several US states now require manufacturers to provide spare parts, tools, and repair manuals. This means you can fix your phone, laptop, or appliance instead of replacing it. Companies like Apple and Samsung now offer self-repair programs. Independent repair shops have legal protection. Your devices can last years longer—saving money and reducing the massive environmental footprint of electronics manufacturing.`,

Modular phones (like Fairphone), repairable laptops (like Framework), and appliances with replaceable parts are becoming available. When one component fails, you replace just that part—not the whole product. Design for longevity, repairability, and recyclability is becoming a competitive advantage. When shopping, look for products designed to last and be fixed.`,

Companies bringing steel, cement, aluminum, fertilizers, or electricity into Europe must now buy carbon certificates at prices that could exceed €100 per ton of CO2. What does this mean for you? Prices on carbon-intensive goods will rise. Products from companies that haven't cleaned up their supply chains will cost more. Carbon is now a direct cost in global trade—and that cost will trickle down to consumers.`,

            intro: `That $10 shirt from your favorite fast fashion brand might seem like a steal, but the real cost is hidden from the price tag. The fashion industry produces 10% of global carbon emissions—more than all international flights and maritime shipping combined. And here's the uncomfortable truth: 72% of college students regularly buy from fast fashion brands. This guide breaks down exactly why cheap clothes are so expensive for the planet, and practical ways to look great without trashing the Earth.`,

                    heading: 'The Shocking Carbon Cost of Fast Fashion',
                    content: `Fashion's carbon emissions rose by 7.5% in 2023—the first increase in four years, driven by "ultra-fast fashion" brands. The industry now emits approximately 1.2 billion tons of CO2 annually. A single cotton t-shirt generates about 2.1 kg of CO2, while a pair of jeans produces around 33.4 kg. When you consider that the average American discards 82 pounds of textiles annually, with 85% ending up in landfills, the scale of the problem becomes clear.`,
                    tip: `Before your next shopping trip, calculate the true cost: that $10 shirt has about 10 kg of CO2 embedded in its production, transportation, and eventual disposal.`
